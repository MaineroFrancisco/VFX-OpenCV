# Resume

Collection of VFX algorithm (handmade) build with C++23, using OpenCV library for image manipulation, and to compare with alredy build in algorithms, and ImGUI library to create a small interface.

This repository is created as a way to learn and understand the underlaying of algorithms used on the VFX world for cinema.
This collection is build as i read along the [_Richard Radke - Computer Vision for Visual Effects_](https://cvfxbook.com/about/) book.
